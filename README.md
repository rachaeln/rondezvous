Team FunFinder generated idea for RONDEH for HACKPRINCETON on the weekend of 11/11-11/13.

# Rondeh is a spin on the word rendezvous, meaning to meet up at a mutual location.

The files provided in this repository are dedicated for the basis of an iOS app that is the functioning social network that will be Rondeh. Written using React-Native by first-timers at a hackathon! The file provided will create an app with a well-designed home-page including a search bar(minimal functionality so far), the logo, the motto, and a background that are structured for a simple and clean looking homepage. 

Planned functionality to be added. We want Rondeh to access Google Places’ API so that a user can find a suggested list of activities that are possible with the locations near them. This feature will be combined with an active online community which will help group people together to meet, hangout, and have fun performing the suggested activities. One final feature that could be added or linked with Facebook’s API for events would allow people to host events that will be added to this suggested list. The main function is to get people trying new things with new people in a world that is growing easy to hide with electronics. Let’s use them to help people rendezvous with others to break the same pattern of daily interactions!
